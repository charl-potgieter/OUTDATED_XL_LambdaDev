I should abstract away the export to xml away into the liststorage class (and remove the listobj method)
 
Update isempty to be able to also refer to the filtered list

Delete the XML mapping after export

Whem saving lamdbas to XML add an extra field for repo name = workbook name

Maybe request target path for lambda exports
 * and remember previous choice
 * notify of file overwrite

Instead of adding the Lambda repos to active workbook add them to the addin workbook so they can be imported into any workbook - how can they be identified and be refreshed?

Create category functionality within the lambdas (most probably have to store in the comments)

 - Lambdas can be refreshed in target sheet with spreadsheetBI, maybe with a listbox of lambda selections so that all lambdas do not clutter up spreadsheet
    
 - Maybe create an add-in with a combined roll of generator of table as well as refresher of defined names

 - Need to complete Function IsValidRepo

 Create a XL LambdaDev tab on ribbon

  How hard would it be to create Excel formula language support in Visual Studio code
 * Additioal complexity would be difficulty in gettign defined tames and tables columns to autocomplete

 How do I ensure that user incudes a reference - maybe create a test before running at each entry point

 When will I receive below update with the new Lambda functions and improvements?
