Adopt below approach for passing lambda info to userform
* pass Lambda storage as a property - currenty in place
* dont pass additional details such as categories (currently in place, need to remove)
* Create a method in the userform to uddate form based on Lambda storage:
    * updates categories
    * reads data into dictionary



Cannot add a custom type to a dictionary - looks like I will need to create a class
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9178177/how-to-put-user-defined-datatype-into-a-dictionary

I am tempted to store TypeLambdaData as a dictionary rather than an array
 - name will be the key hence that field can be removed from type
 - being able to reference the required formula detail by name a lot more elegant than looping


Work towards getting function and parameters displayed in formula wizard

Ideally I should check that XML generator has parameter and description for each 
parameter
* May not be worth the effort
* Difficult to parse commas within brackets and quotes in order to count parameters



Need to work out how to manage potential forumula incosistencies that may arise between info stored in the ListObject and the name manager (say user manually changes)

Consider renaming as PowerFunctions

When creating the Lambda names
 - add a some sort of flag at start of comment to indicate this is an imported lambda name.  Maybe <PowerFormulaImport> <YYYMMMDD HHMMSS>
 - all imported lambda names should be deleted before importing new ones
 - maybe keep the Lambda URL in the comment - this way I can track
  - When adding lambda to names maybe get rid of the excess spaces and newlines in the formula? Will save space given only limteded functions are allowed.  Use Worksheetfunction.trim

When formulas are refreshed in target --> create a summary of changes including duplicate names not converted to lambdas  (update z_LibListObject to allow a copy to be made - which can be used for comparison purposes)

Create a check before creating lambda name to ensure that the (trimmed) formula does not exceed allowed length

Add functionality to delete all repos

Add functionality to replace repos with selection - needs to be a single column only

How to I handle cases if same formula name across multiple repos

Build a check before XML export to ensure no duplicate formula names (this will only solve the issue in a single repo though)

Create code to list repos in active spreadsheet

How do I want to store the repo data in the target sheet (if at all?)
 - maybe just the lambdas imported?
 - how about creating teh query in the add in (which does not get saved)
 - Lambda and associated metadata is stored in target workbook (can use additional hidden names to store additional metadata?  Alternative store on hidden sheet?) --> maybe a very hidden sheet will be cleaner?
 - Active repos also need to be saved somewhere

In AddGitRepo
 - uncomment code that sets storage sheet to very hidden


C:\Users\charl\Dropbox\Dropbox_Charl\Computer_Technical\Programming_GitHub\XL_PowerFunctionLibrary
 - Add all formulas from LambdaWorkings into LambdaLibrary


Create a generator file in XL_PowerFunctionLibrary  --> refer to the outdated ExcelLambdas for formulas

VBA library Update isempty to be able to also refer to the filtered list?

Instead of adding the Lambda repos to active workbook add them to the addin workbook so they can be imported into any workbook - how can they be identified and be refreshed?

Create category functionality within the lambdas (most probably have to store in the comments)

 - Lambdas can be refreshed in target sheet with spreadsheetBI, maybe with a listbox of lambda selections so that all lambdas do not clutter up spreadsheet
    
 - Maybe create an add-in with a combined roll of generator of table as well as refresher of defined names

 - Need to complete Function IsValidRepo



 Create a XL LambdaDev tab on ribbon

  How hard would it be to create Excel formula language support in Visual Studio code
 * Additioal complexity would be difficulty in gettign defined tames and tables columns to autocomplete

 How do I ensure that user incudes a reference - maybe create a test before running at each entry point

 When will I receive below update with the new Lambda functions and improvements?
