Consider renaming as PowerFunctions

How about
 - store repo URLs in target workbook
 - On refresh
    * Create lambda map sheet
    * Loop repos
    * import xml data into listobject 
    * copy into ListStorage (may not be necessary as can set overwrite = false in the first step above)
    * Add repoURL to the imported formula table (wont be able to do this with XML)
    * Maybe later create a summary of changes including duplicate names not converted to lambdas



How do I get a z_LibObject as a power query --> I may have to add functionality to code library
 - Add a CreateFromPowerQuery option

Add functionality to delete all repos

Add functionality to replace repos with selection - needs to be a single column only

Need to allow a single spreadsheet to source from multiple repos

How to I handle cases if same formula name across multiple repos

Build a check before XML export to ensure no duplicate formula names (this will only solve the issue in a single repo though)

Create code to list repos in active spreadsheet

How do I want to store the repo data in the target sheet (if at all?)
 - maybe just the lambdas imported?
 - how about creating teh query in the add in (which does not get saved)
 - Lambda and associated metadata is stored in target workbook (can use additional hidden names to store additional metadata?  Alternative store on hidden sheet?) --> maybe a very hidden sheet will be cleaner?
 - Active repos also need to be saved somewhere

In AddGitRepo
 - uncomment code that sets storage sheet to very hidden


C:\Users\charl\Dropbox\Dropbox_Charl\Computer_Technical\Programming_GitHub\XL_PowerFunctionLibrary
 - Add all formulas from LambdaWorkings into LambdaLibrary


Create a generator file in XL_PowerFunctionLibrary  --> refer to the outdated ExcelLambdas for formulas

VBA library Update isempty to be able to also refer to the filtered list?

Instead of adding the Lambda repos to active workbook add them to the addin workbook so they can be imported into any workbook - how can they be identified and be refreshed?

Create category functionality within the lambdas (most probably have to store in the comments)

 - Lambdas can be refreshed in target sheet with spreadsheetBI, maybe with a listbox of lambda selections so that all lambdas do not clutter up spreadsheet
    
 - Maybe create an add-in with a combined roll of generator of table as well as refresher of defined names

 - Need to complete Function IsValidRepo



 Create a XL LambdaDev tab on ribbon

  How hard would it be to create Excel formula language support in Visual Studio code
 * Additioal complexity would be difficulty in gettign defined tames and tables columns to autocomplete

 How do I ensure that user incudes a reference - maybe create a test before running at each entry point

 When will I receive below update with the new Lambda functions and improvements?
